# school-projects

This repository contains the projects I completed while in school at NC State. 
The csc116 folder contains my work from the "Introduction to Computing - Java" class where I learned the java language and experienced following strict style guidelines. 
The csc216 folder contains the projects from the class "Programming Concepts - Java", which extended my experience with Java and also introduced me to using an IDE while programming as well as including extensive unit testing for all the code produced in a project.
